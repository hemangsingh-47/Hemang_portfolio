- The default system cursor should be hidden across the website.
- Display a custom cursor (dot + ring or minimal shape) by default.

Hover & Click Behavior:
- When the user hovers over interactive elements (buttons, links, cards, inputs):
  - The custom cursor should smoothly fade out or scale down to zero (appear hidden).
- When the user clicks anywhere on the page:
  - The custom cursor should briefly hide and reappear smoothly.
- Cursor transitions must be smooth (no sudden flicker).

UX Requirements:
- Cursor hide/show animations should feel natural and premium.
- Cursor must reappear automatically when the mouse leaves interactive elements.
- Ensure cursor behavior works consistently across all sections.
- Disable custom cursor on mobile and touch devices for better usability.

Goal:
The custom cursor interaction should enhance user experience subtly, making interactions feel clean, modern, and distraction-free.
==============================
RESUME PREVIEW & DOWNLOAD (IMPORTANT)
==============================

- Include a dedicated Resume Card or Resume Section.
- The resume should be a PDF file stored in the project.
- Resume card behavior:
  - By default, show a clean resume thumbnail or icon.
  - On hover over the resume card:
    - Show two animated buttons:
      1. "View Resume" (opens PDF in a new tab)
      2. "Download Resume" (downloads the PDF)
  - Buttons should appear with smooth fade / slide animation.
- Resume card must feel professional and minimal, not flashy.
- Ensure accessibility and mobile-friendly behavior.

Goal:
Allow recruiters to quickly preview or download the resume with minimal friction.

==============================
THEME TOGGLE (LIGHT / DARK MODE)
==============================

- Add a small floating theme toggle button in one corner of the screen.
- Allow switching between:
  - Light theme
  - Dark theme
- Smooth theme transition animation (colors, background, text).
- Remember selected theme using local storage.
- Theme toggle should be minimal and unobtrusive.

Goal:
Give users control while maintaining a clean UI.

==============================
BACKGROUND MICRO-ANIMATIONS (SUBTLE)
==============================

- Add minimal background animation elements:
  - Floating shapes / dots / blobs
  - Low opacity
  - Slow movement (floating, fading, drifting)
- Background elements should subtly react to cursor movement:
  - Slight parallax shift
  - Gentle fade or movement on cursor proximity
- Ensure:
  - Animations are very subtle
  - No performance impact
  - No distraction from main content

Goal:
Add depth and life to the background without making the UI feel busy or over-designed.

==============================
QUALITY CONSTRAINTS (VERY IMPORTANT)
==============================

- Avoid excessive animations.
- Maintain fast load times.
- Keep all interactions smooth and intentional.
- The portfolio must feel premium, calm, and professional.

==============================
FINAL EXPERIENCE GOAL
==============================

The website should feel like a polished product, not just a portfolio — subtle interactions, smooth animations, and thoughtful details that leave a strong impression on recruiters and developers alike.
==============================

- Use minimal floating elements such as:
  - Soft blobs
  - Dots
  - Gradient shapes
  - Light particles
- Elements should have:
  - Low opacity
  - Slow movement
  - Smooth fading in and out

Cursor Interaction:
- Background elements should gently react to mouse movement:
  - Slight parallax shift based on cursor position
  - Soft attraction or repulsion effect near the cursor
  - Smooth easing (no sharp movements)
- Movement must feel calm and premium, not playful or distracting.

Technical Guidelines:
- Use GSAP or CSS animations for smooth performance

==============================
SUBTLE 3D BACKGROUND OBJECT
==============================

- Add a decorative 3D object in the background to enhance visual depth and modern design.
- The 3D object must remain subtle and must NOT distract from the main content.

Technology Requirements:
- Use React Three Fiber (Three.js for React)
- Optional use of Drei helpers for lighting, environment, and controls

3D Object Design:
- Use a clean, modern, developer-themed object such as:
  - Floating geometric shape (sphere, torus, abstract blob, cube cluster)
  - Glass / metallic / gradient material
- Object should have soft lighting and smooth shading
- Avoid heavy textures or high polygon models

Animation Behavior:
- Object should slowly rotate or float continuously
- Movement should feel calm and elegant
- Add gentle parallax response to mouse movement
- Add slight scale or glow effect when cursor comes near

Interaction Rules:
- Object must remain in background layer
- It must never block text or UI elements
- Object opacity or blur may reduce when content overlaps
- No clickable interaction required (purely decorative)

Performance Guidelines:

> ### 🏗️ Technical Implementation Rules
>
> **1. Apply theme via HTML attribute:**
> ```js
> document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'ocean');
> localStorage.setItem('selectedTheme', 'ocean');
> ```
>
> **2. On page load — no flicker:**
> ```html
> <!-- In <head>, before any CSS loads -->
> <script>
>   const t = localStorage.getItem('selectedTheme') || 'light';
>   document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', t);
> </script>
> ```
>
> **3. Global smooth transition on every element:**
> ```css
> *, *::before, *::after {
>   transition: var(--transition-theme);
> }
> ```
>
> **4. Background atmospheric lighting on `<body>`:**
> ```css
> body {
>   background-color: var(--bg-primary);
>   background-image: var(--bg-glow-hero), var(--bg-glow-section);
>   background-attachment: fixed;
>   color: var(--text-primary);
>   font-family: var(--font-family-body);
>   line-height: var(--line-height-body);
> }
> ```
>
> **5. Custom scrollbar per theme:**
> ```css
> ::-webkit-scrollbar { width: 8px; }
> ::-webkit-scrollbar-track { background: var(--scrollbar-track); }
> ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb { background: var(--scrollbar-thumb); border-radius: 99px; }
> ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover { background: var(--scrollbar-thumb-hover); }
> ```
>
> **6. Text selection color per theme:**
> ```css
> ::selection { background: var(--bg-selection); color: var(--text-primary); }
> ```
>

Here's your detailed prompt:

---

**🎨 AI Image / Background Generation Prompt:**

> A futuristic tech website background featuring **abstract 3D geometric shapes** — low-poly wireframe pyramids, floating hexagonal prisms, translucent octahedrons, and shattered polygon fragments suspended in deep space. The shapes are interconnected by glowing thin neon lines suggesting a neural network or data grid. Color palette: **deep midnight navy (#0a0f2c) base**, with glowing accents in **electric cyan (#00f0ff), violet (#7b2fff), and cool white**. Shapes have a glass-morphism / holographic sheen with subtle reflections and depth-of-field blur on distant elements. Soft volumetric fog between layers adds depth. The composition is **asymmetric and layered** — denser clusters on left and bottom, fading to sparse on the right for text readability. Lighting: rim-lit from top-left with a subtle lens flare. Style: **ultra-realistic 3D render, Blender/Cinema4D aesthetic, 8K, dark tech UI background, no text, no people.**

**🛠️ Where to use this prompt:**

| Tool | Best For |
|---|---|
| **Midjourney** | Highest visual quality |
| **DALL·E 3** | Quick iterations |
| **Adobe Firefly** | Commercial-safe use |
| **Leonardo.AI** | Fine-tuned control |
| **Stable Diffusion** | Free + customizable |

**💡 Tip:** Add `--ar 16:9` at the end for Midjourney to get a widescreen website banner ratio, or `--ar 1:1` for a square section background.

Want me to also **build this directly as an animated Three.js background** for your website instead?
